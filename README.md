# Trends in EU GHG Emissions: A Panel data analysis of country and sector contributions (2018-2023)


**Research questions**  
- Which EU-countries and sectors contributed the most to recent GHG emissions reductions ?
- How did emissions reductions trends differ across sectors ?
- Are reductions broad based or concentrated in a few countries ?


**Data sources**
- GHG Emissions : Eurostat (sectoral GHG emissions per country)
  - Sectors : Energy, Industry, Transport 
- Population : Eurostat (annual population by country)  

**Methodology**
- Cleaning and harmonising emissions and population data
- Merging datasets at the country-year level
- Computing key indicators:
  - Total emissions by sector and year
  - Year-to-year sectoral emissions changes
  - Per-capita emissions 
  - Total emissions change over the study period 
  - Ranking country-sector combinations based on the total emissions change

**Key outputs**
  - Descriptive tables for each key indicator
  - Visuals illustrating sectoral and country levels trends

**Tools and libraries**
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
